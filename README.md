# Simple Calculator

This is my first Python project — a simple calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations like 
addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus and power using conditional statements

## Project Description
The Simple Calculator allows users to perform basic math operations by taking user input for two numbers and an operator.  
It helps beginners understand how Python handles user input, conditionals (`if-else`), and basic arithmetic logic.
